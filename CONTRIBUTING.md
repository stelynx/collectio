# Contriguting guidelines

This document contains rules on how to open a new issue or pull request.

## Opening an issue

Everyone is welcomed to open an issue with a suggestion for new feature or bug report.

## Opening a pull request

Opening a pull request is a bit more complicated. Any pull request opened must have a corresponding issue. Each pull request must have a resolving keyword with issue number in the body, so that when pull request is closed, issue is automatically closed. The title of pull request must be matching the title of the issue it is resolving (it will later be merged via _Squash and merge_ option).
